The Fitness tracker app is a basic app that allows you to track how many calories you will/did burn during a specified workout. Simply select the type of workout and then the length of time and it will display approximately how many calories were burnt. You can also submit a request to add a certain workout and the admin may add it to the list. Finally click on the description page to read up on all the great benifits of daily excersizing. Thank you!
